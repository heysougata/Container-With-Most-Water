# Container-With-Most-Water
Container With Most Water solve using python.
Given N non-negative integers a1,a2,....an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i,0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that it contains the most water.

Note : In Case of single verticle line it will not be able to hold water.
# Your Task :
You only need to implement the given function maxArea. Do not read input, instead use the arguments given in the function and return the desired output. 

* Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
* Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
